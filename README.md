# Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) Implementation

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based on the seminal paper "Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks" by Kipf and Welling. Link to the paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907)

## Overview

The Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is a type of neural network architecture designed for semi-supervised learning on graph-structured data. It leverages graph convolutions to capture both local and global structure in the data, making it particularly effective for tasks such as node classification in graphs.

## Implementation

The implementation is done in PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework. The code is structured to follow the architecture and principles outlined in the original paper. It includes functionality for loading the Cora and Karate dataset, as these are commonly used datasets and also used in the paper.
